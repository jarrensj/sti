## project description

This project has a page where people can anonymously submit other people’s name and a note into a database and where people can check with a verification method (for example phone number and confirmation code) the messages they have received such as suggestion to test for a STI. We want it to be anonymous submission so people that are not comfortable telling their family member, friend, or partner a suggestion to test or even just general advice that might be hard to say in person like “I think you need to sleep more hours every night” but also make sure that a person can only see the results if they are the person concerned.
